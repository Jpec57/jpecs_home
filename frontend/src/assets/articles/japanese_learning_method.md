## Introduction

**"大丈夫ですか？"** (_daijoubu desu ka?_), **"行ってきます！"** (_ittekimasu_) or even **"やめてください！"** (_yametekudasai_) for the most dangerous ones out there.

Sounds familiar right ? If you are reading this, you are likely a weeb or a wannabe weeb anyway... But, have you ever wonder how awesome would it be to _really_ speak japanese ? By _really_, I mean not only to impress your mom or to sound weird in front of your colleagues at work.

I've asked myself the same question about a year and an half from now and I wanted to share with you my own journey and maybe help you build your own path towards your japanese goal!

## Motivations

To begin with, you must have some ground motivations. **Why would you like to learn japanese for ?** Could it be to watch _animes_ in their original versions ? To read _mangas_ in their original language so as to grasp as deep as possible the meaning of each chosen words and feelings of characters ? Or maybe are you just curious and excited at the idea of _decyphering_ a new, unknown language ? Motivations can come out of anywhere and take any kind of forms. Honestly speaking, I don't think that their origins are really important (each person is different after all), but they have to be strong enough to push you forwards when needed.

Personally, I've started learning japanese for two main reasons:

- I wanted to be able to read mangas in Japanese.
- I simply love learning new things.

Curiously, I've almost never read any mangas before. Well, a few ones as a kid when my mom was shopping and I wanted to spend some time reading in the manga section of the mall instead (don't judge me, I was far from being alone to do so!). However, a few friends of mine were constantly reminding me that I should be reading One Piece (a real masterpiece if you ask me) and someone said to me a quote that stayed in my mind for a few days "Animations are just an interpretation of a manga". Well, when we see what kind of interpretation some can have while reading Death Note (Yeah, I'm talking about this "famous" live-action from Netflix...), I guess it could be interesting to compare mangas and animes.

So... I decided to give it a shot! After all, I would only gain at trying this. I think that you should have at least two kind of motivations to ensure your progress along the road. The first one is to have **a _ground_ reason** to learn, something constantly here but not perpetually strong. The second one is **a goal to look for**.

By setting you a goal, you will be able to measure your progress during the journey. For this reason, I tend to prefer long term goal not particulary precise. But if you somewhat lack of _ground_ motivation to begin with, it could be interesting to cut this goal into several intermediary smaller goals to thrive through this process.

### Takeaway of this part:

> Be motivated (you will need this state of mind)!
> The best is to have a ground reason (curiosity in my case) to learn and a goal to aim (reading manga) as the goal can help you measure your progress.
> Don't hesitate to cut this goal into several smaller ones if it helps you keep being motivated!

## Common excuses

**"I don't have enough time"**. This one is by far the worst excuse that I have ever heard. People tend to use this excuse too lightly and for all sort of activities. Bear in mind that **you will NEVER have time to do something if you don't TAKE that time**.

Do I wake myself up at 6 in the morning just for fun ? No, clearly, no. I've just a shit ton of things to do in a day and that I want to be done by the end of the day. Thus, hearing this excuse from someone that spend an average of 2 hours per day watching TV can be sometimes annoying. Please don't be that guy.

However, you don't have to be this strict to yourself and don't have to categorize any free time you are giving to yourself as a shame. **People need to rest, it's even part of a learning process!** If you were to skip rest days, you'll end up overdoing it and learn nothing out of your lessons. Busy week ? What about reducing the average time spent learning japanese ? A minimum of one or two hours a week seems essential to me to prevent forgetting learned lessons.

I recommend learning at **a fixed hour during the day**. It helps me building a routine and I like to think that my brain gets easily in the state of mind of learning knowing in advance my schedule. You won't ask yourself whether or not you will be in the mood to learn, your body will get ready by itself. By setting up a routine, you won't see it as a chore but rather as something simply being part of your day. It takes about a month or so to see the benefit of a routine, so why not gritting your teeth until then and see what it is like ?

"I don't like learning". This one is hard for me to answer. Obviously since my ground motivation is passion for learning, I may not be in a good position to argue about this excuse. Nevertheless, there are plenty resources out there that could help you see learning in a different light. It is maybe one of the key point to be successful in this journey: you have to be happy to learn. We will speak more about this in the "Useful resources" section.

### Takeaway of this part:

> Find your own rythm: choose your pace through trials and errors first, but try to stay above an hour a week.
> Try to be consistent and have a fixed hour to learn.
> Find the way of learning that will help you see memorization as funny.
> Don't forget to rest.

## Personal advice

Outside the basic advice given in the previous section, I will here give you some tips to keep you motivated during your learning process. but keep in mind that those basic advice are not basic because they are easy to give. They are simply the key to success and you cannot hope to get anywhere without them.

**The common mistake made with these advice is to overlook the need of finding one's pace.**

The burn out will quickly appear to the ones among you that want to burn steps. I know, it's hard. You can be either too excited and want to learn as many things as possible or, at the opposite, forcing yourself to do a lot in the beginning to push you into your routine.
It's not a race and your brain won't follow you in the long term. Maybe you are quite used to learn quickly to pass an exam and you succesfully remember a hundred words in a day ! おめでとうございます! But will you be able to remember all of those hundred words in a week ? What about a year ? **Start slowly** and learn your pace as days go by.

Seeing a friend that started the challenge of learning a language with you doing tremendous progress in a short amount of time can be discouraging. To be honest, I even think that in most of the cases, learning with someone is not a good idea. The learning process is something personal. Each person has his own rythm. To keep up with someone you may overdo it or slack off a little to wait for your friend. Instead of learning together, trying to speak or write to someone at your level or above is far more interesting and won't put any pression on you (you really don't need that).

Structure is essential in learning. It's true that you will find many, many different ways to learn Japanese that will suit you. But keep it mind that even if your goal is not to pass an exam or validate a certain level of profiency in Japanese, the structured path given by the JLPT is something really important and should be the core of your learning. Moreover, it will help you see your progress when reaching one level, so don't overlook it ;) My goal has nothing to do with level to begin with (reading mangas), but you will more likely waste your time if you do not focus on structuring your learning. Note that it should be the core of your learning but not entirely if it's not your main goal ! Personally, I read mangas and learn each new interesting words that I encountered during my reading section while working on my grammar.

### Takeaway of this part:

> Again: **find your OWN rythm**
> Keep the learning a personal thing, but eventually share your progress with your friends.
> Structure your learning with leveled resources, but don't forget to learn with your own way as well.

## Useful resources

### WaniKani and Bunpro

[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) is the first resource ever that I've used to learn Japanese. More precisely, it's a program to help you learn 2000 kanji and 6000 vocabulary words in about 1 year for the quick learners. I really love this program and I can't help but to recommend you trying it. Its community is just AMAZING and you will find a lot of different topics going on the Japanese culture, book clubs or anything that could come to your mind. Especially cat. I've almost immediately bought a lifetime access to this program. It uses mnemonic (little stories in fact) to help you remember kanjis and cut kanjis into radicals (smaller parts) to build a logical story around it. Moreover, its system relies on the [SRS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), system that I consider as the most effective one to learn something. I've even decided to do [my own application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jpec.benkyou_app) using this very same system.

The equivalent, and good complementary tool, for grammar is [Bunpro](https://www.bunpro.jp/). Really useful as well even if some bugs may appear on the SRS sometimes. Learning grammar had greatly improved my learning abilities and I was really happy to work on this.

### Shinkanzen Master

This is a must have. I really really insist on this. Currently, I am using only this collection of books as grammar support (and since yesterday for listening practice), besides my own Application _Benkyou_. Written in Japanese, but with the english translations for the first volumes, it will help you jump directly into it!

The use case of any grammar point is thoroughly explained and having the correction of exercises despite not having the translation of the sentences used are of a great help. It pushes me into looking for translation and working more on the resource or simply thinking more intensely on the solution. This is a good compromise compared to "Tobira: Gateway to advanced japanese" where no correction is given to you (I've only tried a few pages but sticked to Shinkanzen as I find it more adapted to learning as autodidact).

### Youtube

Here is a small list of some youtubers that I listen to while doing some chores or walking. It's a good way to learn something during a short interval of free time.
They are classed from the more accessible for beginners to the most complicated one. However, I consider Sambon Juku as a reference as he'll explain to you grammar points... In Japanese only. It's a big step, but be sure to take that one because the quicker you will be facing real japanese, the better will it be.

I am also interested in listening to podcasts in Japanese, but didn't really take the time to search for it on Spotify. But I'll be very happy to get recommendation from you :D

### Others resources

Knowing that I'm learning Japanese, my family also bought me some useful resources, but not corresponding really to my current level. However, you should definitevly take a look at these resources if you are a beginner :

- [Assimil](https://www.amazon.fr/Superpack-japonais-Contient-cl%C3%A9-audio/dp/2700580907/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=assimil+japonais&qid=1612720380&s=books&sr=1-2): I'm putting this one first as it has really blown my mind. It progressively makes you work into Japanese without you noticing it ! Starting from French instructions, to mixed Japanese/French instructions and finally Japanese only; using romaji to kana; all while learning points from day to day situations regrouped in 98 lessons. Really worth the buy if you want my opinion. However, I don't think that the whole pack is needed. It's really expensive and the audio support isn't really used (you won't have question using the support only). They are simply reading in Japanese... You'd better buy the book only for about 26€.
- [Le Japonais comme au Japon](https://www.amazon.fr/japonais-comme-Japon-Chotto-Nihongo/dp/2753578176/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1UFFKY3919RC7&dchild=1&keywords=le+japonais+comme+au+japon&qid=1612720596&s=books&sprefix=le+japonais+comme+%2Cstripbooks%2C159&sr=1-1): I was really interested in this one but it starts from scratch and for the moment I've got a lot of different resources to deal with.
- [Le Japonais en Manga](https://www.amazon.fr/Japonais-Manga-Nouvelle-%C3%A9dition-01/dp/2344018816/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/260-2216833-1414768?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=2344018816&pd_rd_r=9e8ef566-cd3a-4406-a765-594b537b18c4&pd_rd_w=vB9Ju&pd_rd_wg=nh65N&pf_rd_p=368989f4-f820-4983-a3af-0354cd7992b0&pf_rd_r=9AKRVN9G8NRS2VYARFM3&psc=1&refRID=9AKRVN9G8NRS2VYARFM3): Starting from scratch, it could be interesting for people having the same initial goal as me.
- [Benkyou](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jpec.benkyou_app). Well, my application. I'm not particulary proud of this one and maybe only using 10% of its functionality but the fact is... It's the one I am using every day. You can save grammar points from the Shinkanzen to benefit from the SRS System (that why I am not using Bunpro anymore... because I have my own version of it in fact) and look up new words while reading which will be saved as SRS cards as well. By this way, it doesn't interrupt your reading and you will memorize the words. You can save them in bundle to organize your reviews later. Maybe one day I'll have enough time to make a better version of this one, but before that, I'll keep using it on a daily basis.

## Going further and setting new goals

As you progress in your journey, you will likely see new goals coming out of nowhere. As far as I am concerned, two new goals appeared.

The first one, kind of obvious for any _otaku_, is to be able to watch animes in Japanese. Not that I want to quit reading mangas, but rather for complementary. I'll eventually discuss about the main differences between reading mangas and watching animes and their respective advantages in a different article, but this is not the point here.

The second one is growing out of a complex. It's always a little tricky to justify oneself as able to read Japanese but not being able to speak Japanese at all. Isn't it a little ironical to buy the "Shinkanzen Master Bunpou N2" (N2 Japanese Proficiecy Level could be compared to a B2 proficiency level) at Junku (A Japanese library store in Paris hold by natives) in French ?

Despite saying that, I still believe that my method consisting in focusing exclusively on one language aspect is the best suited for me. By doing this, I've reached my goal in a short/correct amount of time and it even pushes me to complete my Japanese skills.

## Conclusion

I hope that some of my advice will eventually reach someone and give him/her the strength to take the plunge. This is my own personal experience with learning Japanese, I am not a teacher nor an expert in Japanese. So please, don't take this as immutable truth and forge your own idea ! I'll be happy to discusss about it so don't hesitate an send me a message if you want to share something this me 🤓.
