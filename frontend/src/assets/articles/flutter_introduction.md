## What is Flutter ?

According to the official Website:
```
Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
```
D'après le site officiel, Flutter est une boîte à outils permettant de créer nativement des applications mobile, web et bureau.
## Why Flutter ?

With Flutter you can write code once in Dart, and run it on multiple platforms.

Flutter supports both Material Design and the Cupertino design language.

```
if (Platform.isIOS) {
  // Use Cupertino on iOS
  return buildCupertinoWidget(context);
}
// Use Material design on Android and other platforms
return buildMaterialWidget(context);
```

Dart is the only mainstream language that can be compiled both Just In time (JIT) and Ahead Of Time (AOT).


If you compare native apps and flutter on the basis of its performance in the flutter code is written in dart and which excludes JavaScript bridge and it helps to boost its performance in terms of speed which is 60 FPS.
